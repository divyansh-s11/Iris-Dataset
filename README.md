Information
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?

Widely used for tasks such as classification and clustering, particularly for tutorial/teaching purposes

Additional Information

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

This is an exceedingly simple domain.

This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net ).  The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.
